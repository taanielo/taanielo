# Experience

## Sideproject - Dazzme.io
2024

Simple social photo game website, where users can create account, upload their photos and play photo reveal game, where participants can guess what or who is on the photo. The idea was born after office Christmas party,
where I created simple HTML & JS prototype for such game and it received a lot of positive feedback.

Main motivation was to learn something new that everyday job didn't provide. Learned how to setup AWS infra (EC2, S3, RDS, SES, VPC) from sandbox to production, Google workspace for domain emails and lists, React (TypeScript) from zero to hero,
Gradle multimodule project (frontend, backend), vertical slice architecture, single page application together with Spring Security using Java Web Token authentication method, Spring Batch processing to generate thumbnails in the background.
Additionally, what are the first features that provide immediate value and where to go from there, what are private info (personal photos) storage requirements and much more.  It was super fun try!
